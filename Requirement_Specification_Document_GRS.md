## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document
This document defines the requirements for the **GRS Tool**, which validates, manages, and migrates design log records within the Facets environment. It serves as a reference for stakeholders (configuration teams, QA teams, administrators, and business users) to ensure a shared understanding of tool functionality, limitations, and objectives.

### 1.2 Scope of the System
The GRS Tool allows users to upload design log files in the **1D development region**, validate the data, and identify records requiring updates or corrections. The tool highlights errors (in red), supports editing, deleting, and updating of records, and ensures validated data can be migrated across environments (**1D → 1R → 1P**).

**Primary Goals:**
- Improve accuracy in design log records.
- Provide a streamlined process for validation.
- Ensure controlled migration to production.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- **Configuration Team:** Validate and correct records.
- **QA Team:** Test and ensure data quality in 1R.
- **Business Users/Stakeholders:** Monitor correctness of data before production.
- **System Administrators:** Manage tool setup, deployment, and support.

### 1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **GRS:** GRS Tool.
- **1D:** Development environment.
- **1R:** QA/Testing environment.
- **1P:** Production environment.
- **Facets:** Core system where validated data is migrated.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The GRS Tool is a **middleware solution** that connects design log records with the Facets environment. It ensures data integrity before records are promoted to production.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Upload design logs into the tool.
- Validate uploaded records automatically.
- Highlight erroneous records in red.
- Provide UI-based options to edit, delete, or update records.
- Migrate validated data into Facets (**1D → 1R → 1P**).

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- Configuration team members with basic technical knowledge.
- QA team members with testing and validation skills.
- Business stakeholders who require reporting but may not use the tool directly.

### 2.4 Constraints
- Migration sequence is mandatory (**1D → 1R → 1P**).
- Errors must be resolved prior to migration.
- Access is **role-based** (editing restricted to configuration team).
- Compliance with enterprise security standards (encryption, audit logging).

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The design log format is standardized.
- Facets system must be available and connected.
- Migration depends on approvals from QA.

## 3. Functional Requirements

**Note:** Each functional requirement is uniquely numbered for traceability.

### 3.1 Detailed List of Features and Behaviors
- **Record Upload:** Users can upload design log files.
- **Validation:** Automatic validation of records.
- **Error Highlighting:** Invalid records are flagged in red.
- **Editing:** Users can update records directly in the tool.
- **Deleting:** Records can be removed if necessary.
- **Updating:** Records can be corrected and revalidated.
- **Migration:** Approved records are migrated to Facets.

### 3.2 Use Cases
- **UC-01: Upload Log File**  
  A user uploads the design log for validation.
- **UC-02: Correct Errors**  
  A configuration team member edits a flagged record.
- **UC-03: Migrate Data**  
  Validated records are sent to Facets **1D → 1R → 1P**.

### 3.3 Inputs, Outputs, and Interactions
- **Input:** Design log file.
- **Output:** Error report, validated records, migrated data.
- **Interaction:** UI-based validation and record correction.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Validation should process up to X records within Y minutes.
- **Security:** Role-based access; audit logs for edits and deletions.
- **Usability:** Simple UI for non-technical users.
- **Reliability:** Records must not be lost during migration.
- **Scalability:** Tool should support growing data volumes.

---

## 5. External Interface Requirements

### 5.1 User Interfaces
- Web-based UI for record upload, error display, and editing.

### 5.2 Hardware Interfaces
- Runs on standard enterprise servers.

### 5.3 Software Interfaces
- Integration with Facets system for data migration.
- Possible API endpoints for external validation.

### 5.4 Communication Interfaces
- Secure internal network connection between tool and Facets environments.

---

## 6. Appendices

### 6.1 Glossary
- **Validation:** Checking records against business rules.
- **Migration:** Moving data across environments (**1D → 1R → 1P**).

### 6.2 References
- Internal process documentation.
- Facets system integration guides.
